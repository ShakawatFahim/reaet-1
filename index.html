            <h2>GAMING IS NOT A CRIME. IT JUST A PASSION AND A GOOD WAY TO SPENT LEISURE TIME...</h2>
            <p>Gaming is the running of specialized applications known as electronic games or video games on game
                consoles
                like
                X-box and Playstation or on personal computers (in which case the activity is known as online gaming).
                The
                term
                "gaming" originated as a synonym for "gambling" although most electronic games today do not involve
                gambling
                in
                the traditional sense.</p>
